## Purpose

`cubrid-cookbook-python` provides use-case-centric, production-style Python examples for CUBRID.

## Read First
- `README.md`
- `docs/internal/PRD.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Repository Structure

```
quickstart/        → 5-minute getting-started examples
migration/         → Language migration guides (Java → Python)
templates/         → Copy-and-customize production starters
performance/       → Benchmark-backed optimization patterns
pitfalls/          → Common anti-patterns and fixes
fundamentals/      → Step-by-step reference for core operations
```

## Working Rules

- This is a **Python-only** repository. No Node.js, Go, Rust, or TypeScript content.
- Treat examples as user-facing reference implementations, not throwaway demos.
- All content must be written in **English**.
- Use `cookbook_` table prefix in all SQL examples.
- Avoid CUBRID reserved words in column names: `value` → `val`, `count` → `cnt`, `data` → `file_data`.
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` in all Python files.
- Use parameterized queries (`?` markers) — never string interpolation.
- If an example's setup or dependencies change, update the surrounding docs in the same change.
- Avoid adding hidden prerequisites that are not documented.

## Development Workflow (cubrid-lab org standard)

All non-trivial work across cubrid-lab repositories MUST follow this 4-phase cycle:

1. **Oracle Design Review** — Consult Oracle before implementation to validate architecture, API surface, and approach. Raise concerns early.
2. **Implementation** — Build the feature/fix with tests. Follow existing codebase patterns.
3. **Documentation Update** — Update ALL affected docs (README, CHANGELOG, ROADMAP, API docs, SUPPORT_MATRIX, PRD, etc.) in the same PR or as an immediate follow-up. Code without doc updates is incomplete.
4. **Oracle Post-Implementation Review** — Consult Oracle to review the completed work for correctness, edge cases, and consistency before merging.

Skipping any phase requires explicit justification. Trivial changes (typos, single-line fixes) may skip phases 1 and 4.

## Validation

- `docker compose up -d` (starts CUBRID 11.2)
- Run the relevant example: `python <file>.py`
- Verify output matches expected behavior
- `docker compose down`

## Issue Labeling (cubrid-lab org standard)

When creating an issue in **any cubrid-lab repository**, assign exactly one
`priority: <value>` label and exactly one `size: <value>` label at creation time,
alongside a type label (`bug`/`enhancement`/`documentation`/`chore`/`ci`/…) and an
`area:` label when applicable. These must be GitHub labels, not just text in the
issue title or body.

Use the following exact names, with **one space after the colon**:

- Priority: `priority: critical`, `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`.
- Size: `size: XS`, `size: S`, `size: M`, `size: L`, `size: XL`.

Do not introduce variants such as `priority:high`, `priority-high`, `P1`, or
`size:S`. Reuse the repository's canonical labels; if a required label is missing,
create it with the exact name above before filing the issue. This policy governs
new issue creation, not bulk renaming or relabeling existing issues unless
explicitly requested.

Priority reflects urgency and impact; size estimates implementation effort and
helps contributors pick appropriately scoped work.

| Label | Meaning | Rough guide |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `size: XS` | Trivial change | < ~10 lines; single-file typo/config/one-liner |
| `size: S` | Small change | One file or one focused function; a single test or doc page |
| `size: M` | Medium change | A few files; a new test module, a bug fix with tests, a CI job |
| `size: L` | Large change | Cross-cutting change across many files; multi-artifact (e.g. demo GIF + video + docs) |
| `size: XL` | Very large | Consider splitting into smaller issues before starting |

Rules:

1. **Size reflects effort, not importance** — a one-line fix for a critical bug is still `size: XS`.
2. **Assign both `priority:` and `size:` when filing the issue.** If scope or impact
   is uncertain, use a provisional estimate, explain the uncertainty in the body,
   and add `status: needs triage` (or the repo's equivalent). Refine the estimates
   during triage rather than omitting either required label.
3. **`good first issue` should be `size: XS` or `size: S`.** If a good-first-issue grows
   past `size: S`, re-scope it or drop the `good first issue` label.
4. **`size: XL` is a signal to split**, not a green light to start a sprawling change.

## Documentation definition of done

Any change that adds, renames, removes, or alters the behavior of an example — or changes supported CUBRID/driver/Python versions — MUST update the matching documentation in the **same PR**. At minimum keep in sync: `SUPPORT_MATRIX.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md` (incl. version badges/claims), and any affected `docs/`.

If no documentation change is needed, state the reason explicitly in the PR body as `Docs: not needed - <reason>` or apply the `docs-not-needed` label. This is enforced by the `docs-sync` CI check (which complements phase 3 of the workflow above).

Do not mark work complete until code, tests, and documentation are consistent.

## Project Context

> This repo is the **Python cookbook** for the CUBRID ecosystem.
> Board: [CUBRID Ecosystem Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/cubrid-lab/projects/2)

### Role

cubrid-cookbook-python provides copy-and-run examples for Python developers adopting CUBRID.
All examples must be independently runnable against CUBRID 11.2 via Docker.

### Key Sections

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `quickstart/` | Get running in 5 minutes |
| `migration/java-to-python/` | Side-by-side Java JDBC → Python migration (killer content) |
| `templates/` | Production-ready application starters |
| `performance/` | Benchmark-backed optimization (linked to cubrid-benchmark data) |
| `pitfalls/` | Common mistakes with CUBRID reserved words, auto-commit, etc. |
| `fundamentals/` | Core DB operations: connect, CRUD, transactions, ORM |
